        <h2>Quotes About Life</h2>
        <p>"You know, some people say life is short and that you could get hit by a bus at any moment and that you have to live each day like it’s your last. Bullshit. Life is long. You’re probably not gonna get hit by a bus. And you’re gonna have to live with the choices you make for the next fifty years.” - Chris Rock“       Taking responsibility – practicing 100 percent responsibility every day – is about seeing ourselves not as right or wrong, but as an agent, chooser, problem solver, and learner in the complex interrelationships that make up our lives.” - Linda Galindo

        <h3>The Blue Sky</h3>
        <p>Blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere. Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time. Closer to the horizon, the sky fades to a lighter blue or white.</p>
